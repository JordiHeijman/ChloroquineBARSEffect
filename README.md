This GitHub page contains the source codes in Myokit file format (.mmt) for:

1. Base model of Heijman 2011 Canine Ventricular Epicardium and O'Hara-Rudy 2011 Human Ventricular Epicardium (with BARS +/-)
2. 0-dimensional simulation of CQ and AZM (rate dependence)
3. Population-based study divided into 2 parts:
	- Part 1 contains the code to generate random variability of ionic currents
	- Part 2 to run the data obtained in Part 1 for specific conditions (+/- ISO, +/- CQ and AZM)
